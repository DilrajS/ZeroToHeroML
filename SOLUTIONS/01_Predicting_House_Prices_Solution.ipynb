    "# Predicting House Prices\n",
    "Welcome to the first project in the ZeroToHeroML series! In this project, we will dive into a classic machine learning problem - predicting house prices. We'll be using the Boston Housing dataset, which is available through the `sklearn.datasets` library, making it easy to access and use for our purposes.\n",

    "## Objective\n",
    "Our goal is to build a simple linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on various features like the number of rooms, age, distance to employment centers, and more.\n",

    "## The Boston Housing Dataset\n",
    "The Boston Housing dataset contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass. It has 506 entries with 13 features that might help us predict the median value of owner-occupied homes. Let's get started!"
