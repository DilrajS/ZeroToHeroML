# ZeroToHeroML: From Novice to Expert in Machine Learning

Welcome to ZeroToHeroML, a comprehensive guide for those eager to master machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Designed with beginners and intermediates in mind, this project offers a structured journey through hands-on projects in Google Colab, covering fundamental concepts to advanced applications in the world of ML/AI.

## Project Overview

ZeroToHeroML provides a step-by-step learning path, introducing learners to essential ML/AI concepts, techniques, and real-world applications. Through interactive Google Colab notebooks, you'll progress from foundational topics to complex algorithms, building your knowledge and skills along the way.

## Getting Started

Everything you need to begin is a Google account. Our projects utilize Google Colab, allowing you to write and execute Python code through your browser with no setup required:

- **No Installation Needed**: Directly access projects via Colab links.
- **Cloud-Based Learning**: Leverage GPUs and TPUs for intensive computations.
- **Open Access**: Google Colab is available free of charge.

## Table of Contents

1. **[Introduction to ML/AI](INTRODUCTION_TO_ML_AI.md)**: Your starting point to grasp the basics and understand the landscape of ML and AI.
2. **[Projects](PROJECTS/)**: Embark on hands-on projects, each with a TODO version for you to complete:
   - [Predicting House Prices](PROJECTS/01_Predicting_House_Prices_TODO_Version.ipynb): Start with simple regression to predict housing prices.
   - [Image Classification with CNNs](PROJECTS/02_Image_Classification_TODO_Version.ipynb): Dive into convolutional neural networks to recognize visual patterns.
   - [Natural Language Processing](PROJECTS/03_Natural_Language_Processing_TODO_Version.ipynb): Process and analyze text data using NLP techniques.
3. **[Solutions](SOLUTIONS/)**: After attempting the projects, compare your work with the solutions:
   - [Predicting House Prices Solution](SOLUTIONS/01_Predicting_House_Prices_Solution.ipynb)
   - [Image Classification with CNNs Solution](SOLUTIONS/02_Image_Classification_Solution.ipynb)
   - [Natural Language Processing Solution](SOLUTIONS/03_Natural_Language_Processing_Solution.ipynb)
4. **[Datasets](DATASETS/)**: Explore datasets used in the projects and learn how to load and manipulate them.
5. **[Extras](EXTRAS/)**: Further your learning with quizzes, assessments, and additional resources.
