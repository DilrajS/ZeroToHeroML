# ZeroToHeroML: From Novice to Expert in Machine Learning

Welcome to ZeroToHeroML, a comprehensive guide for those eager to master machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Designed with beginners and intermediates in mind, this project offers a structured journey through hands-on projects in Google Colab, covering fundamental concepts to advanced applications in the world of ML/AI.

## Project Overview

ZeroToHeroML provides a step-by-step learning path, introducing learners to essential ML/AI concepts, techniques, and real-world applications. Through interactive Google Colab notebooks, you'll progress from foundational topics to complex algorithms, building your knowledge and skills along the way.

## Getting Started

Everything you need to begin is a Google account. Our projects utilize Google Colab, allowing you to write and execute Python code through your browser with no setup required:

- **No Installation Needed**: Directly access projects via Colab links.
- **Cloud-Based Learning**: Leverage GPUs and TPUs for intensive computations.
- **Open Access**: Google Colab is available free of charge.

## Table of Contents
