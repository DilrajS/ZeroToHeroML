# ZeroToHeroML: From Novice to Expert in Machine Learning

Welcome to the ML/AI Basics repository! This project is designed to offer a comprehensive learning path for those interested in exploring machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Through hands-on projects in Google Colab, you will dive into the fascinating world of ML/AI, from understanding fundamental concepts to applying them in real-world scenarios.

## Project Overview

This repository is structured to guide beginners and intermediate learners through the fundamentals of ML and AI to practical application in projects. It's a blend of theory, practical exercises, and assessments to solidify your understanding and skills in ML/AI.

## Getting Started

To dive into these projects, all you need is a Google account. We use Google Colab for all projects, which allows you to write and execute Python in your browser:

1. **No setup required**: Simply click on the Colab links provided in each project folder to open the notebook.
2. **Run code in the cloud**: Execute code in the browser with access to powerful hardware accelerators like GPUs and TPUs.
3. **Free access**: Google Colab is freely available for anyone with a Google account.

## Table of Contents

1. **[Introduction to ML/AI](INTRODUCTION_TO_ML_AI.md)**: Start here if you're new to ML/AI. This document covers the basics, prerequisites, and offers resources for further learning.
2. **[Projects](PROJECTS/)**: Hands-on projects categorized by learning complexity:
    - [Supervised Learning](PROJECTS/Supervised_Learning/)
    - [Unsupervised Learning](PROJECTS/Unsupervised_Learning/)
    - [Reinforcement Learning](PROJECTS/Reinforcement_Learning/)
3. **[Datasets Guide](DATASETS/datasets_guide.md)**: Learn how to access and use datasets directly from popular Python libraries or public sources.
4. **[Extras](EXTRAS/)**: Enhance your learning with quizzes, assessments, and a list of further readings.
